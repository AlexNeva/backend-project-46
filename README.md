# About The Project

The File Difference Analyzer is a powerful tool designed to compare two files and accurately identify their differences. Whether you're working with text, code, or data files, this application streamlines the process of spotting changes, ensuring that no detail goes unnoticed.

The tool provides the flexibility to output the differences in various formats, including plain text, side-by-side comparison, and more. This versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of use cases, from simple file comparison tasks to complex version control and quality assurance processes.

With an intuitive user interface and robust functionality, the File Difference Analyzer is an essential utility for developers, writers, and anyone who needs to keep track of file changes efficiently.

Feel free to adjust any part of this to better fit your needs!
